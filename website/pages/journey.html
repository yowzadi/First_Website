		<h1>My Journey</h1><hr></br></br>
		<h2><u>First Step</u></h2>
		<p>My first step was in india Those first steps leave footprints on your heart forever i first tried to crawl around i felt that achievement in my haert then i did it more and more until i thought i should try to stands and i held on to the furnature then i pushed up and i took few step forward Walking is easy... stopping is a whole other thing .Putting on the brakes is a totally different skill set. For me and many other, the easiest way to stop walking is to simply fall over. But there's just something so major about walking. when I was an active little kid., but it's just part of my natural process.Kids who are learning to walk are called "toddlers" because that's exactly what they do and i do when i was young . keeping their legs wide apart and seeming to hesitate between each step,i was jerking from side to side as i move one foot forward, then the next.From a very young age, i strengthens my muscles, slowly preparing to took my first steps. Between 6 and 13 months, i started crawling. Between 9 and 12 months, i pull my self up. And between 8 and 18 months, i started walk for the first time!</p></br>

		<h2><u>Moved to Australia</u></h2>
		<p>Australia is an incredibly diverse country, and is home to so many different wonderful cultures and communities. But there is something truly unique that links everyone together here – a one-of-a-kind shared spirit and attitude that is the Australian way of life From laid-back attitudes to a serious love of nature and sports, here’s what you need to know about the Australian lifestyle.There’s something Aussies are known the world over for, and that’s their easy-going, friendly attitude. Of course food, events, art and history are all vital parts of the Australian culture, but what really distinguishes an Aussie is his or her laid-back outlook on life. It’s the way friends turn up unannounced for a catch-up (but always with a six-pack of beer in hand). It’s the reason you’ll hear the words “no worries, mate” exchanged between strangers on the street. Most of all, it’s about putting aside stress to appreciate the good things in life that are right in front of you.</p></br>

		<h2><u>Kindy and Schooling</u></h2>
		<p>I remember my first day at school it was a memorable experience when I was 4 years young. On my 1st day at school, I wokeup early and I had my morning tea. I got my favourite colored backpack that time my favourite color was green.  I had my first video game as Ninetendo's WII Console. I loved to play Super Mario and Spider-man. Luigi was my favourite character and I also had "Luigi" soft toy that I used to carry with me wherever I go. I wasn't having much friends, so I made more and more until I got so so much of them.</p></br>
