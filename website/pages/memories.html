		<p>I have got many beautiful memories of my life. I am sharing here some moments of my life ;like my old friend, i learned to walk, 1st photo and first game i played (i.e;Super Mario). My 1st day at School. My first trip at School. It felt to me like so many hours of school when i was young. When i was 1 year and 2 month, I had my first walk. When i was 1 year and 8 months, i came to Australia and now i wear Ortho Kinetics lenses to avoid wearing glasses. I only have to wear them at night and take them out when I wakeup in the morning. Those lenses are expensive than normal lenses but it cures eyes and prevent Myopia</p>
