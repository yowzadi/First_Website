			<h2><u>Play Group</u></h2>
			<p>In play group i was 3 in that they get us use to kindy and school like what time is for Crunch n Sip, Snack, Launch and what time snack play n launch playA pre-school playgroup, or in everyday usage just a playgroup, is an organised group providing care and socialisation for children under five. The term is widely used in the United Kingdom. Playgroups are less formal than the preschool education of nursery schools. They do not provide full-time care, operating for only a few hours a day during school term time, often in the mornings only. They are staffed by nursery nurses or volunteers, not by nursery teachers, and are run by private individuals or charities, rather than by the state or companies.</p>
			<h2><u>kindy</u></h2> 
			<p>Kindy is when I was four i was in kindy. Kindyis a school before primery school. Kindy is a play-based learning program for children in the year before school. The attributes and skills that children develop at a quality kindy can set them up for success at school and in life! At kindy, kids learn through play and other fun and enriching activities from a qualified Early Childhood Teacher.</p>
			<h2><u>Reception</u></h2>
			<p>I was 5 when i got into Reception i was in primery school. There is no reception year in Scotland as children progress directly from Nursery to Primary 1 (equivalent to English Year 1) in the August nearest their fifth birthday. Generally this means that a complete intake into P1 ranges from four and a half to five and a half years old.[4] If a child is still age 4 on the day they would usually start primary 1, their legal guardian has the right to delay (or defer) when they start primary school. This means they can start school the following year, when theyâ€™re 5.</p>
			<h2><u>Year 1</u></h2>
			<p>Now i got in to year 1 then i had years in that time i was 6. Year One is an educational year group in schools in many countries including England, Wales, Australia and New Zealand. It is usually the first year of compulsory education and incorporates students aged between five and seven.</p>
			<h2><u>Year 2</u></h2>

			<h2><u>Year 3</u></h2>
